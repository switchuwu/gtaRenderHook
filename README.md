# GTA rendering hook

GTA rendering hook

Implements DirectX11 and Vulkan rendering API to GTA 3, GTA VC and GTA SA.


Currently there are 2 versions, one of which is broken(can't really build it anymore):

* Old one which implemented only DirectX11 and had a few features(only GTA SA)
* New one which at the moment runs only on RTX hardware and uses vk_nv_ray_tracing extension(to be replaced with KHR one
  once it is implemented in release drivers)

We have [discord server](https://discord.gg/rsZEUNW), come and help to improve it!

## How it works?

TL;DR: Currently we have incomplete RW rendering backend implementation that communicates via shared memory to
incomplete rendering engine instance running rendering loop based on Vulkan API.

Long version:

* Game rendering engine code is partially redirected to shared memory task queue
* Task queue loads game assets to GPU memory, processes various requests like retrieving supported resolutions etc.
* One of the tasks prepares a frame to framebuffer based on uploaded scene data, each frame draw calls is uploaded to
  64bit process via task queue.
* Separation between rendering and game code is done for several reasons:
    * It allows to use newer drivers, and support raytracing extensions
    * It allows to use more memory if needed
    * Surprisingly it works faster!
* Rendering right now is basic, and very hacky:
    * BLAS is built for each model instance being loaded by the game. For GTA 3 we load some sectors around the player
      using original lod system.
    * Animations are prepared by compute shaders and rebuilt every frame
    * TLAS is rebuilt every frame
    * Scene is loaded to GPU, contains all materials, textures, vertex/index buffers and transform data
    * Lights are prepared using very basic tiled culling implementation
    * Primary rays are traced to compute G-Buffers: Albedo, Normals, LinearDepth, Motion vectors and Material params
    * AO rays are traced, temporally accumulated and blurred via bilateral blur with varying kernel(based on temporal
      variance)
    * Shading for sunlight and each point light inside a tile is generated, then temporally accumulated and blurred via
      bilateral blur(based on temporal luminance variance)
    * Reflections are traced with one shadow ray per-pixel and blurred via same filter that is used for shading
    * Everything is combined based on material properties etc.
    * Immediate 3D objects are drawn on top(with depth from G-Buffer)
    * Immediate 2D objects are drawn on top

## Current requirements to build development source code

1) VCPkg
2) Cmake
3) Visual Studio/CLion
4) C++ compiler with c++20

## Build instructions

1. Setup libraries via vcpkg(all dependencies are listed in response_file.txt)
2. Prepare environment:
    * GTA_3_FOLDER, GTA_VC_FOLDER and GTA_SA_FOLDER should be set to some places where you want resulting executables to
      be.
    * When building 32bit binaries use only BUILD_32BIT_LIBS
    * When building 64bit binaries use BUILD_32BIT_LIBS and ARCH_64BIT
    * Loading mod requires [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) installed.
    * For GTA 3 it'll work only on steam, v1.1 and v1.0 at the moment.
3. Build x86 and x64 libraries/executables in release or debug configuration using configured CMake.
4. Run, test and report bugs and incompatibilities!

## Tips

1) If you encounter bug please report it, and attach .log files and crash dumps and build/game version if possible to
   bugreport
2) It's buggy and code is bad at the moment, sorry in advance :)
